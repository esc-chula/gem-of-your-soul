### Conventional Commit Format

In short, the commit message should look like this:

```
git commit -m "feat: <what-you-did>"

# or

git commit -m "fix: <what-you-fixed>"

# or

git commit -m "refactor: <what-you-refactored>"
```

The commit message should start with one of the following types:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  For more information, please read the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) documentation.
